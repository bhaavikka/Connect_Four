## **Features**
- **Two-player mode**:
  - A human player competes against the AI.
  
- **AI with Minimax Algorithm**:
  - Evaluates moves to play optimally.
  - Uses Alpha-Beta Pruning to improve efficiency.

- **Dynamic UI**:
  - Built using **Pygame** for an interactive gaming experience.
  - Highlights player and AI moves in real-time.

- **Win Detection**:
  - Automatically detects when a player wins or if the board is full.

## **Getting Started**
1. **Install Required Libraries**:
   - Ensure you have Python installed.
   - Install the following libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install pygame numpy
     ```

2. **Run the Game**:
